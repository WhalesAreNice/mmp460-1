Your web page is framed by the viewport: the browser window or the deviceâ€™s screen. If the viewport is large you have a choice between using it all of ots space or further framing the page with a smaller frame.

![full screen]({{site.url}}/mmp460/assets/full-screen.gif)

Web page spreads to take all of the viewport's space.

![smaller frame]({{site.url}}/mmp460/assets/small-frame.gif)

Web page takes a portion of the viewport's space.



**Page elements should be place in relation to their frames** 

In the examples above elements are aligned to create a rectange that is of the same proporion of the page's frame. In the illustration below, the placement of page elements in relation to their frame is inconsistent, creating a disorganized page.
