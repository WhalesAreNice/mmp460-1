title: Framing
---

Your web page is framed by the viewport: the browser window or the deviceâ€™s screen. If the viewport is large you have a choice between using it all of ots space or further framing the page with a smaller frame.

![full screen]({{site.url}}/mmp460/assets/full-screen.gif)

![smaller frame]({{site.url}}/mmp460/assets/small-frame.gif)


**Page elements should be place in relation to their frames** 

In the examples above elements are aligned to create a rectange that is of the same proporion of the page's frame. In the illustration below, page elements are placed in varied relation to the frame
