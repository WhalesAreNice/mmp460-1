Your web page is framed by the viewport: the browser window or the deviceâ€™s screen. If the viewport is large you have a choice between using all of its space, or further framing the page with a smaller frame.

![full screen]({{site.url}}/mmp460/assets/full-screen.gif)<br>
Web page spreads to take all of the viewport's space.

![smaller frame]({{site.url}}/mmp460/assets/small-frame.gif)<br>
Web page takes a portion of the viewport's space.



### Page elements should be placed in relation to the page's frame

In the illustrations above elements are aligned to create an invisible rectange that is of the same proporion as the page's frame. In the illustration below, the placement of page elements in relation to the page's frame is inconsistent, creating a disorganized page.
