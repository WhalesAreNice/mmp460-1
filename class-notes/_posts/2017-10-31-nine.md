#### WordPress Theme Building ####
We start with the [undescore](https://underscores.me/) theme with the following modifications:
- [Bootstrap](http://revitalk.com/mmp460/wordpress/underscore/2017/10/04/bootstrap.html)
- [Front-page template](http://revitalk.com/mmp460/wordpress/underscore/2017/10/02/homepage.html)
- [Category template](http://revitalk.com/mmp460/wordpress/underscore/2017/08/13/category-underscore.html)

In addition, we will create additional [custom page templates](http://revitalk.com/mmp460/wordpress/2017/08/13/custom-templates.html), custom post templates, or custom category templates, depending on your designs.

These custom templates need to include multiple editable areas so our client can create complex pages, such as the author pages that include, bio, synopsis, image, podcasts and more. We will accomplish this by using [custom fields](https://codex.wordpress.org/Custom_Fields). 

To manage custom fields We will use the [Advanced Custom Fields plugin](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). Download and install the  [Advanced Custom Fields plugin](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). We will still need to add php code to display custom fields in pages. We will use [the API](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/#functions) of this plugin.

**You must have wireframe design for all key pages before starting WP theme work.**
