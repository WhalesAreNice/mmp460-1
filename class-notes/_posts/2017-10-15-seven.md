#### Group Project ####
A WordPress website that documents the work done by past, present and future cohorts of the BMCC Foundation Time-Warner Screenwriting Fellowship. The website will present the work of the last cohort, from Fall 2016, and will make it easy for the site administrator to add future cohorts.

For each fellowship participant the website will include:
- synopsis
- visual Lead
- audio from gala reading (podcast)
- about the author + contact info

Additional possible content:
- about the Screenwriting Fellowship
- about Professor George Stevenson
- news and events
- online application

**About the Fellowship**: the Fellowship includes instruction and workshops that allow participants to develop a first draft of a feature screenplay or long-form television pilot over 14 Saturdays and concludes with a gala presentation of readings from the completed scripts featuring professional actors. Fellows also participate in four weekday evening screenings/seminars (open to all) and pre-or post-seminar dinners with established screenwriters. [More about the Fellowship](http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/media-arts/page.jsp?pid=1060&n=Screenwriting%20Fellowship).
